You need to remember the following points about a few important classes in java.util.concurrent package:
1. ExecutorService interface extends Executor interface. While Executor allows you to execute a Runnable, ExecutorService allows you to execute a Callable.  
2. Executors is a utility class that provides several static methods to create instances of ExecutorService. All such methods start with new e.g. `newSingleThreadExecutor()`. You should at least remember the following methods: `newFixedThreadPool(int noOfThreads)`, `newSingleThreadExecutor()`, `newCachedThreadPool()`, `newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()`, `newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize)`.
